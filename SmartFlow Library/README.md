## What is SmartFlow?

SmartFlow is an intelligent water management system designed to monitor and optimize water usage. It enables users to track water levels, detect leaks, and manage water supply efficiently. With the SmartFlow Arduino Library, you can integrate this smart technology into your Arduino-based projects and applications.

## Features

- Real-time water level monitoring: Get accurate readings of water levels in your tanks or containers.
- Leak detection and alerts: Be notified when leaks are detected to prevent water wastage and potential damage.
- Automated water supply management: Control and automate water refill based on preset conditions.
- User-friendly interface: Easy-to-use functions and commands for seamless integration with your Arduino/Esp projects.
- Low memory footprint: Designed to be efficient with minimal memory usage, making it suitable for various Arduino/Esp boards.

## Installation

To use the SmartFlow Arduino Library in your projects, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/TheZeroHz/SmartFlow%20Library/releases) section.
2. Open the Arduino IDE.
3. In the Arduino IDE, click on "Sketch" > "Include Library" > "Add .ZIP Library..."
4. Select the downloaded SmartFlow library .zip file.
5. The library should now be installed, and you can access it from the "Sketch" > "Include Library" menu.

## Getting Started

To get started with SmartFlow, make sure you have the following components:

## Example Sketch

Here's a simple example to get the current water level from the SmartFlow sensor:

```cpp
#include <SmartFlow.h>

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
}
